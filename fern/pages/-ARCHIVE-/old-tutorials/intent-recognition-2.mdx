This endpoint classifies text into one of several classes. It uses a few examples to create a classifier from a generative model. In the background, it constructs a few-shot classification prompt and uses it classify the input texts you pass to it.

Chatbots are designed to understand and respond to human language. They need to be able to understand the text they hear and understand the context of the conversation. They also need to be able to respond to peopleâ€™s questions and comments in a meaningful way. To accomplish this, chatbots must be able to recognize specific intents that people express in conversation.

Here is an example of classifying the intent of customer inquiries on an eCommerce website into `Shipping and handling policy, Start return or exchange`, or `Track order`.
