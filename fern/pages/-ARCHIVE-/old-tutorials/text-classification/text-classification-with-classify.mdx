 You can find more information about the endpoint [here](/reference/classify).

In this section, we show how to use the [Classify](/reference/classify) endpoint to do sentiment classification for the kind of customer satisfaction survey responses an e-commerce website may receive.

## The Problem We Want to Solve

For this demo, let's assume that we want to classify a set of reviews for a newly-released feature into positive and negative classes. We might for instance have a review like this:

`The item exceeded my expectations`

that we want to classify as a positive review.

Naturally, the same techniques that we'll use for this problem can be used for any other task where we want to classify a given text according to a fixed set of classes.

## Using Classify For Our Task

Classify takes in example inputs with their labels, as well as the input texts we aim to classify. It then trains a classifier using the power of an embeddings model. 

You can either do this with our baseline classification model (described in the next few sections), or you can train a custom classification model for better performance (described in the final section). 

### Examples

Labeled examples are used to demonstrate the classification task to the model. Examples provide two important pieces of information:

- The inputs and expected outputs for the task we're interested in.
- The number of output classes. Every class should appear in at least one example in the labeled examples.

In this case we will be passing in the following examples:
