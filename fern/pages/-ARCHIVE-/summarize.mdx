<Note title="This Guide Uses the Summarize Endpoint. "> 
 You can find the API reference for the endpoint [here](/reference/summarize-1).
</Note>

This endpoint generates a succinct version of the original text that relays the most important information. 

Ideal use cases include, but are not limited to: news articles, blogs, chat transcripts, scientific articles, meeting notes, and any text that you should like to see a summary of!

The endpoint can:

- Summarize a single document
- Control output length 

<Info title="Experimental Features">
 These features are extremely experimental. Using these feature could lead to a substantial decrease in performance over the overall model. It is included as a feature based on user feedback — and our team is actively working on delivering a better solution. Because it is critical for some applications, we have exposed an experimental version. If you do try it out, we welcome your feedback.
</Info>

- Format chosen output
- Handle long documents
- Provide additional instructions to focus the summary

We recommend leveraging the playground for quick use cases, but for any repeated utilizations we strongly recommend the API. An example is provided below.
