At Cohere, we are committed to breaking down barriers and expanding access to cutting-edge NLP technologies that power projects across the globe. By making our innovative multilingual language models available to all developers, we continue to move toward our goal of empowering developers, researchers, and innovators with state-of-the-art NLP technologies that push the boundaries of Language AI.

Our Multilingual Model maps text to a semantic vector space, positioning text with a similar meaning in close proximity. This process unlocks a range of valuable use cases for multilingual settings. For example, one can map a query to this vector space during a search to locate relevant documents nearby. This often yields search results that are several times better than keyword search.

## Use Cases

- [Multilingual Semantic Search](/docs/multilingual-semantic-search): Improve your search results regardless of the language.
- [Aggregate Customer Feedback](/docs/customer-feedback-aggregation): Organize customer feedback across hundreds of languages, simplifying a major challenge for international operations.
- [Cross-Lingual Zero-Shot Content Moderation](/docs/cross-lingual-content-moderation): Identify harmful content in online communities is challenging, especially as users speak hundreds of languages. Train a model with a few English examples, then detect harmful content in 100+ languages.

## Get Started

To get started using the multilingual embed models, you can either query our endpoints or install our SDK to use the model within Python:
