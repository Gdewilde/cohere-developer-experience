- **[Deploying with FastAPI](/docs/deploying-with-fastapi)**: Build a sentiment analysis classifier and deploy it with FastAPI.
- **[Deploying on Google Sheets with Google Apps Script](/docs/cohere-google-sheets-apps-script)**: Use Cohere and Google Apps Script to add large language model (LLM) capabilities to Google Sheets documents.
