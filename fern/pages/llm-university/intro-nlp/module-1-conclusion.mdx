This appendix helped you familiarize yourself with some of the traditional methods used to build NLP models. It also provided an overview of the process for creating a text classifier to help you understand the task in detail, and evaluating this classifier. In this module, you also explored NLP's history, how it has progressed over time, and the concepts involved in text pre-processing.

The first module of the course will get more into the specifics of large language models, and how they operate. Happy learning!
