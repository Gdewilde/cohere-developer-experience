Welcome to the Semantic Search Module! We are Jay and Luis, your instructors.

In this module, you’ll learn about information retrieval systems (search), and how to incorporate them with LLMs to build powerful applications. 

Here are the chapters and topics that we’ll cover:

- **[What is Semantic Search?](/docs/what-is-semantic-search)**: Learn how to use embeddings and similarity in order to build a semantic search model.
- **[Keyword Search](/docs/keyword-search)**: Learn to use keyword search to query a large dataset.
- **[Dense Retrieval](/docs/dense-retrieval)**: See how dense retrieval can outperform keyword search.
- **[ReRanking](/docs/reranking-2)**: Learn how to use Rerank to significantly boost any search system.
- **[Generating Answers](/docs/generating-answers)**: Learn how to leverage a search system to reduce LLM hallucinations.
- **[Further Reading](/docs/further-reading-search)**: Explore suggested resources to continue your learning.
- **[Conclusion - Semantic Search](/docs/search-conclusion)**: Recap what you have learned.
