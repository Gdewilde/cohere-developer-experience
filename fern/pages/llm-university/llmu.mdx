We‚Äôre so happy that you‚Äôve chosen to learn Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with us.

Our comprehensive curriculum aims to give you a rock-solid foundation in NLP, equipping you with the skills needed to develop your own applications. Whether you want to learn semantic search, generation, classification, embeddings, or any other NLP technique, this is the place for you! We cater to learners from all backgrounds, covering everything from the basics to the most advanced topics in LLMs, ensuring you can harness the full potential of LLMs. Plus, you'll have the opportunity to work on hands-on exercises, allowing you to build and deploy your very own models.

The course covers LLMs starting from the basics, all the way to building and using text representation and text generation models.
