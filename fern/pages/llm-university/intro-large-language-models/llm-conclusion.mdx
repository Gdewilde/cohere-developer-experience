Great job! In this module you learned what are Large Language Models, and how they work. You learned about their architecture and important parts, including embeddings, similarity, and attention mechanisms.

Now that you've learned the theory, you're ready to get some hands-on practice. The following modules will take you through several codelabs, in which you'll learn to build and deploy models using the Cohere endpoints.
