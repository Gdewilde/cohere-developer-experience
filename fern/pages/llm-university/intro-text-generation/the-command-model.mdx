Command can instantly perform many tasks by default. But if you need to incorporate company-specific language or more advanced use cases, then Command can be customized to hyperfocus on your use case.

## Example use cases

### Collaborate With a Helpful Co-Author

Command can [write product descriptions](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/playground/shared-preset?ref=Product-Description-h4eh4j), help [draft emails](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/playground/shared-preset?ref=Cold-Outreach-Email-jdgn1g), [suggest example press release copy](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/playground/shared-preset?ref=Investment-press-release-kkhcx7), and [much more](https://cohere.com/examples).

### In-depth analysis of documents

Ask Command multiple questions about a document in order to assign a category to the document, extract a piece of information, or answer a general question about the document.

### Millions of answers, at your command
