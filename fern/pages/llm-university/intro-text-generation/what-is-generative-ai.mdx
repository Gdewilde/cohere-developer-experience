Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating or generating new content or data. This can be in the form of language, images, videos, and more.

Its market potential is significant as it has the power to revolutionize many industries and drive innovation in a wide range of fields. For example, in creative arts, generative AI can be used to generate unique and engaging content, such as music or visual art, with minimal need for human input. In the business world, generative AI can be used to generate reports, presentations, and other business documents, reducing the need for manual data analysis and enhancing productivity.

In this course, our focus is on language. We want to enable developers to add language AI to their technology stack and build impactful applications with it.

In this module, we will go through everything that you need to know about generative AI with Cohereâ€™s large language models (LLMs).
