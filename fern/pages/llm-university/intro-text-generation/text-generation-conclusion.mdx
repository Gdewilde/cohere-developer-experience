Congratulations! In this module you've learned how to use the Cohere Generate endpoint for tasks such as text generation and entity extraction. You've also learned the science of prompt engineering, that is, using the correct prompts to extract the most power out of your generative model.

Now that youâ€™ve learned how to use the Cohere API to build your own applications, the next step is to deploy and share them with the world. In the next module, you'll learn about the various options for deploying LLM applications.
