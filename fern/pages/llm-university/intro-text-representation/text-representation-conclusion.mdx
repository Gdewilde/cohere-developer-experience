Congratulations! In this module, you've learned how to use the Cohere endpoints for tasks such as text embeddings, semantic search, clustering, and classification.

This should give you a pretty good picture of what text representation is, and how large language models are useful in understanding large text datasets.

In the next module, you'll learn all about another very powerful application of large language models: text generation. Happy learning!
