# Going Live

Upon registration, every Cohere user receives a free, rate-limited Trial key to use with our endpoints. If you find that you are running against the Trial key rate limit or want to serve Cohere in production, this page details the process of upgrading to a Production key and going live.

## Trial Key Limitations

Trial keys for all endpoints are rate-limited depending on the endpoint you wish to use:

| Endpoint                                                                                                               | Calls per Minute |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| [Co.Generate](/reference/generate), [Co.Summarize](/reference/summarize-2) | 5                |
| All other endpoints                                                                                                    | 100              |

If you’d like to use Cohere’s endpoints in a production application or require higher throughput from our endpoints for your usage, you can upgrade to a Production key.

With a Trial Key:

- Organizations can still have unlimited trial keys in the free tier.
- There is a defined usage limit on all the development API keys per minute (all keys add up to that rate limit).
- When a developer/org reaches a rate limit, they will receive an error that they have exceeded the limit/minute.
- Playground usage counts toward your Trial key rate limit.
- If calls exceed the throttling we throw an error that says “Trial keys are throttled. Please upgrade your API key or contact us directly on (Discord)[https://discord.com/invite/co-mmunity].

Trial keys are free to use even after you upgrade to a Production key.

## Production Key Specifications

Production keys for all endpoints are rate-limited at 10,000 calls per minute and are intended for serving Cohere in a public-facing application and testing purposes. Usage of Production keys is metered at price points which can be found on our pricing page. 

To get a Production key, you will need to complete a few steps in our Go to Production workflow. You can start the process by navigating to the Billing and Usage page in your Cohere dashboard as the Admin of your organization (or asking your organization Admin to complete these steps). From there, clicking on the `Get your Production key` button will start the process.

The process takes less than 3 minutes to finish, and enables you to generate a Production key that you can use to serve Cohere APIs in production. If you deploy without completing the Go to Production workflow, your API key may be temporarily or permanently revoked. 

## Go to Production

You must acknowledge Cohere’s [SaaS Agreement](https://cohere.ai/saas-agreement) and [Terms of Service](https://cohere.ai/terms-of-use). Your organization must also read and recognize our [Model Limitations](/docs/model-limitations) and [Model Cards](/docs/generation-card).

You will be asked if your usage of Cohere API involves any of the sensitive use cases outlined in our [Usage Guidelines](/docs/usage-guidelines). Following your acknowledgement of our terms, you will be able to generate and use a Production key immediately. However, if you indicate your usage involves a sensitive use case, your Production key will still be rate limited the same as a Trial key until our Safety team reaches out and manually approves your use case. This will take no longer than 48 hours.

## Track Incidents

Navigate to our [status page](https://status.cohere.ai/) which features information including a summary status indicator, component statuses, unresolved incidents, status history, and any upcoming or in-progress scheduled maintenance. We recommend subscribing for updates with an email or phone number to receive notifications whenever Cohere creates, updates or resolves an incident.
