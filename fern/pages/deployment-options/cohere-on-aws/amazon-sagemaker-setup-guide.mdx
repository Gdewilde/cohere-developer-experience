In an effort to make our language-model capabilities more widely available, we've partnered with a few major platforms to create hosted versions of our offerings.

This document will guide you through enabling development teams to access [Cohere’s offerings on Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=87af0c85-6cf9-4ed8-bee0-b40ce65167e0). 

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully subscribe to Cohere’s offerings on Amazon SageMaker, the user will need the following **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** permissions:  

- **AmazonSageMakerFullAccess**
- **aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions**
- **aws-marketplace:Subscribe**
- **aws-marketplace:Unsubscribe**

These permissions allow a user to manage your organization’s Amazon SageMaker subscriptions. Learn more about [managing Amazon’s IAM Permissions here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/?trk=cf28fddb-12ed-4ffd-981b-b89c14793bf1&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjwsvujBhAXEiwA_UXnAJ4JEQ3KgW0eFBzr5nuwt9L5S7w3A0f3wqensQJgUQ7Mf_ZEdArZRxoCjKQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!652240143562!e!!g!!amazon%20iam!19878797467!148973348604). Contact your AWS administrator if you have questions about account permissions.

You'll also need to install the AWS Python SDK and some related tooling. Run:

- `pip install boto3`. You can find more details about the boto3 library [here](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#install-boto3).
- `pip install cohere-aws` (or `pip install --upgrade cohere-aws` if you want to upgrade to the most recent version of the SDK).

## Cohere with Amazon SageMaker Setup

First, navigate to [Cohere’s SageMaker Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=87af0c85-6cf9-4ed8-bee0-b40ce65167e0) to view the available product offerings. Select the product offering to which you are interested in subscribing.

Next, explore the tools on the **Product Detail** page to evaluate how you want to configure your subscription. It contains information related to:

- Pricing: This section allows you to estimate the cost of running inference on different types of instances.
- Usage: This section contains the technical details around supported data formats for each model, and offers links to documentation and notebooks that will help developers scope out the effort required to integrate with Cohere’s models.
- Subscribing: This section will once again present you with both the pricing details and the EULA for final review before you accept the offer. This information is identical to the information on Product Detail page.
- Configuration: The primary goal of this section is to retrieve the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html) for the product you have subscribed to.

## Next Steps

With your selected configuration and Product ARN available, you now have everything you need to integrate with Cohere’s model offerings on SageMaker. 

Cohere recommends your next step be to find the appropriate notebook in [Cohere's list of Amazon SageMaker notebooks](https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-aws/tree/main/notebooks/sagemaker), and follow the instructions there, or provide the link to Cohere’s SageMaker notebooks to your development team to implement. The notebooks are thorough, developer-centric guides that will enable your team to begin leveraging Cohere’s endpoints in production for live inference. 

If you have further questions about subscribing or configuring Cohere’s product offerings on Amazon SageMaker, please contact our team at [support+aws@cohere.com](mailto:support+aws@cohere.com).
