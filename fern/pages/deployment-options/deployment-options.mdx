## Amazon

Developers can access a range of Cohere’s language models in a private environment via Amazon’s AWS Cloud platform. Cohere’s models are supported on two Amazon services: **Amazon SageMaker** and **Amazon Bedrock**.

### Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is a service that allows customers to prepare data and build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. [Read about SageMaker here.](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/)

Cohere offers a comprehensive suite of generative and embedding models through SageMaker on a range of hardware options, many of which support finetuning for deeper customization and performance.
