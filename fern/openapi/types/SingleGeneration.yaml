    description: "Only returned if `return_likelihoods` is set to `GENERATION` or `ALL`. The likelihood refers to the average log-likelihood of the entire specified string, which is useful for [evaluating the performance of your model](likelihood-eval), especially if you've created a [custom model](/docs/training-custom-models). Individual token likelihoods provide the log-likelihood of each token. The first token will not have a likelihood."
