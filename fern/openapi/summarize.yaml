            value:
              text: "Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or
                dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with
                a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such
                as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or
                peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base
                and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added,
                in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the
                freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces
                and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result
                is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low
                temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as
                its temperature increases.


                The meaning of the name \"ice cream\" varies
                from one country to another. In some countries, such as the
                United States, \"ice cream\" applies only to a specific variety,
                and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various
                terms according to the relative quantities of the main
                ingredients, notably the amount of cream. Products that do not
                meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled
                \"frozen dairy dessert\" instead. In other countries, such as
                Italy and Argentina, one word is used fo\r all variants.
                Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or
                sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,
                almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose
                intolerant, allergic to dairy protein or vegan."
